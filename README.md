For my first ever experience with programming, I turned to the one thing I well and truly know: Football. As a big, big fan of Liverpool Football Club, I decided I wanted to do something related to the current top scorer, Mohammed Salah. The vision I had when I started was to create something the official club account on Twitter could post every time he scores a goal - sort of a celebratory GIF. 

The task proved somewhat more complicated than I had imagined. Underway I encountered several problems, most frustratingly adding a picture of the man himself to the code. For some reason it would not load the picture and kept crashing the program. It turned out all I needed to do was rename the file and create a folder for it in my main p5 folder. The solution, however, required help from our instructor. I found it very difficult to find the error looking at the console, and the process of problem solving proved to be frustrating giving my lack of knowledge. I suspect this process of looking for the flaw is a skill I hope to develop during the course, because I spend a lot of time on that. 

Whilst I had an idea in my head of what the final product should be like, I really just tested a lot of code copied from the website. Bit by bit I assembled all the different parts of the code and made them work together. Sitting in a group also helped, because sharing code with the others helped understanding it better - I also received a lot of help in the form of fragments of code from the others. Generally, I feel as though there's a lot of basic knowledge I lack, which causes unnecessary problems throughout the process. Variables, for example, I find difficult to grasp, which was key in getting the picture to work. I also feel as the I'm sort of a passenger, and the code just works on its own - all I have to do is keep up.  All in all I'm happy with this as my first project, but look forward to learning rapidly.
